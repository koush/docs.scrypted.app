### Scrypted NVR Setup

When using Scrypted NVR, label some faces in the Detections overview tab to start recognizing the people of interest.

### Face Recognition Sensor Setup

1. Set up a smart motion sensor as described in the steps above.
2. In the Detection dropdown, select `face` (Scrypted NVR). The `person` detection type will not work, as that detects the entire person and not specfically the face.
3. Navigate to the `Recognition` tab.
4. Type the name of person to detect as labeled in the prior step. Press enter to add it to the list. Multiple names may be provided, repeat this process for as many people are desired.
5. Set the `Label Distance` to `0` so the name must exactly match.
6. Click `Save`.
