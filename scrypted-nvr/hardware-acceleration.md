## Apple Silicon

Scrypted NVR can leverage the [Neural Engine](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-neural-engine-how-does-it-work/) on the new Apple Silicon chips using the `CoreML Plugin`. Incredible performance at low power. Installing the [Scrypted Desktop App](/desktop-application) is recommended on Mac.

## NVIDIA and AMD

The [Scrypted Desktop App](/desktop-application) can utilize discrete and integrated GPUs for accelerated transcoding, moiton, and object detection.

## Google Coral

Scrypted NVR supports object detection using the [Google Coral.ai](https://coral.ai) accelerators via the `Tensorflow-Lite Plugin`. The PCI and USB models are both supported.

## Intel

Scrypted NVR supports Intel iGPUs and accelerator cards for blazing fast detection performance using the `OpenVINO Plugin`.
