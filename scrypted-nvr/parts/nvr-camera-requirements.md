Only local RTSP Cameras are officially supported by Scrypted NVR. This is typically any camera that implements the `ONVIF` and `RTSP` protocol and uses the `H.264` video codec.

Unsupported hardware (which may work to varying degrees) includes:
  * Cloud cameras like Ring, Google/Nest, and Arlo.
  * Non-native RTSP Cameras like Wyze.
  * Battery powered cameras.
