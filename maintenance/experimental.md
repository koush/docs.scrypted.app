## Cluster Mode

::: warning
`Cluster Mode` currently requires the beta server image and the beta NVR plugin.
:::

`Cluster Mode` enables distributed computing. Plugin, detection, decode, and encode will automatically be assigned to the best suitable machine in a cluster.

A machine can operate in either `server` or `client` mode. There can only be one `server` machine but there may be multiple `client` machines. The `server` machine will ingest the camera streams, while `client` machines will perform detection. Machines in a cluster can be a mix of operating systems and architectures. For example, you can use a NAS saving video Unraid (`server`) with a Mac Mini performing detection (`client`).

### Cluster Server Setup

The Cluster server will ingest the camera streams and save them to the NVR storage.

Create and edit Scrypted `.env` configuration file:

::: code-group

```[Docker Compose]
nano ~/.scrypted/volume/.env
```

```[Proxmox]
nano ~/.scrypted/volume/.env
```

```[Linux]
nano ~/.scrypted/volume/.env
```

```[Mac]
nano ~/.scrypted/volume/.env
```

```[Windows Command Prompt]
notepad %USERPROFILE%\.scrypted\volume\.env
```

:::


```sh
#Set node type.
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_MODE=server
#Set node name.
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_CLIENT_NAME=scrypted-server
# This is the IP of this machine.
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_ADDRESS=192.168.2.130
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_SECRET=swordfish
```

Restart the server.

::: warning
Compute plugins like OpenVINO will fail to load until a Cluster Client is set up and connected in the next section.
:::

### Cluster Client Setup

A Cluster client will perform video decoding and detection.

When adding a client, install Scrypted as usual (and switch to the beta tag). Account creation is not necessary. Once the server is running, create and edit Scrypted `.env` configuration file:


Create and edit Scrypted `.env` configuration file:

```

```[Mac]

```

```[Windows Command Prompt]
notepad %USERPROFILE%\.scrypted\volume\.env
```

:::

```sh
#Set node type.
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_MODE=client
#Set node name.
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_CLIENT_NAME=scrypted-node1
# this is the IP of the server machine,
# matching the SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_ADDRESS in the prior section.
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_SERVER=192.168.2.130
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_SECRET=swordfish
# designate this server as available for decode and detection workloads
SCRYPTED_CLUSTER_LABELS=compute
```

Restart the client.
